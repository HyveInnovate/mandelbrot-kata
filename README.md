# Mandelbrot Kata

This a little programming exercise using the fractal domain, in particular the Mandelbrot Set.

Detailed explanations about the Mandelbrot Set can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

The goals of the kata are:

* Understand a little bit the mathematical concepts behind fractals.
* Apply Test-First Programming approach.
* Improve OO programming skills.

In order to finish the kata you have to draw two versions of the Mandelbrot fractal:

* ASCII graph: see file `mandelbrot-160x160.txt`
* Image (background white and mandelbrot set in black): see file `mandelbrot-160x160.png`

### Math

Basically, there is a mathematical formula for complex number:

```
f(x) = zÂ² + c
```

where `z` and `c` are complex number. 

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers `c` for which the function does not diverge when iterated from z=0.
Than means, given a `c` complex number, if you apply the formula to that number `n` times using the previous result as the new `z` number, that `c` belongs to Mandelbrot Set if the sequence does not diverge.

You can represent those complex number in a graph where x-axis is the real part of the complex number and y-axis is the imaginary part.

### Drawing the fractal

You have to draw the portion of the graph between -2 and 2 real and imaginary parts.
Mandelbrot Set is inside those limits.

### Branches

There is a branch for each language with the scaffolding code.

* php
* javascript

And different solutions in different branches like:

* php-solution1
